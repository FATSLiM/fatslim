Overview
========

FATSLiM stands for "**F**\ ast **A**\ nalysis **T**\ oolbox for **S**\ imulations of **Li**\ pid **M**\ embranes" and its goal is to
provide an efficient, yet robust, tool to extract physical parameters from MD trajectories.

The main objective of FATSLiM is to decrease as possible the amount of time needed to
analyze MD trajectories: the ultimate goal is to process a several-gigabyte-big file is just a
few minutes or less. This is why a rather important part of FATSLiM's development is
focused on code optimization and simplification in order to maximize its efficiency.
